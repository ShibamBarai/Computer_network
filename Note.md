# Computer Networking Notes

## 1) Detailed Discussion on Wireless and Wired Networks

### Wired Networks
A wired network uses physical cables to connect devices. Common examples include Ethernet networks found in homes and offices. 
Devices like desktop computers, printers, and servers are typically connected using copper or fiber optic cables. For instance, a typical office setup might use Cat6 Ethernet cables to connect computers to a central switch or router.

#### Components
1. **Cabling**: The most common types of cables used are:
   - **Twisted Pair Cables**: Such as Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat6a cables. These are widely used for Ethernet connections.
   - **Coaxial Cables**: Often used for cable internet and television.
   - **Fiber Optic Cables**: Use light to transmit data over long distances at very high speeds.

2. **Network Devices**:
   - **Switches**: Connect multiple devices on a local area network (LAN) and manage data traffic.
   - **Routers**: Direct data between different networks (e.g., from a local network to the internet).
   - **Access Points**: Sometimes used in wired networks to provide wireless access.

3. **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Each device needs a NIC to connect to the network, which can be wired or wireless.


#### Advantages
- **High Speed and Low Latency**: Wired connections typically offer faster data transfer rates with minimal delay.
- **Reliability**: Less susceptible to interference from other electronic devices or physical barriers.
- **Security**: More secure since physical access is required to connect devices.

#### Disadvantages
- **Mobility Limitations**: Devices must be physically connected via cables, restricting movement.
- **Installation Complexity**: Setting up a wired network can be more complex and time-consuming due to cabling requirements.
- **Cost of Infrastructure**: The initial setup cost can be higher due to the need for cables and network hardware.

#### Applications
- **Corporate Environments**: Ideal for offices where high-speed internet access is necessary for many users.
- **Data Centers**: Used for connecting servers due to the need for high bandwidth and low latency.
- **Home Networks**: Often used in setups where gaming consoles or desktop computers require stable connections.

### Wireless Networks

Wireless networks utilize radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data without physical connections. 
Common examples include Wi-Fi networks in homes, coffee shops, and public places. Devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets connect to the internet through wireless routers.

#### Components
1. **Wireless Access Points (WAPs)**: Devices that allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
2. **Wireless Routers**: Combine the functions of a router and an access point, providing both wired and wireless connectivity.
3. **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Wireless NICs enable devices like laptops and smartphones to connect wirelessly.

#### Advantages
- **Mobility**: Users can move freely within the coverage area without losing connection.
- **Ease of Installation**: Setting up a wireless network is generally simpler since it doesnâ€™t require extensive cabling.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new devices without worrying about physical connections.

#### Disadvantages
- **Speed Limitations**: Generally slower than wired connections due to signal degradation over distance and interference.
- **Interference Issues**: Signals can be disrupted by walls, furniture, or other electronic devices (e.g., microwaves).
- **Security Risks**: More vulnerable to unauthorized access; robust security measures like WPA3 encryption are necessary.

#### Applications
- **Home Networks**: Commonly used in homes for smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and laptops.
- **Public Wi-Fi Hotspots**: Found in cafes, airports, and libraries, allowing users to connect without needing a wired connection.
- **IoT Devices**: Used extensively in smart homes where various devices communicate wirelessly.

## 2) What are the difference between wired and wireless network.


| **Wired Network**                                  | **Wireless Network**                               |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Uses physical cables (e.g., Ethernet, fiber optics) to connect devices. | Uses radio waves or infrared signals to connect devices without physical cables. |
| Limited mobility; devices must be physically connected via cables. | High mobility; devices can connect from anywhere within the coverage area. |
| Communication medium includes copper wires, fiber optics, or twisted pair cables. | Communication medium is air (electromagnetic waves). |
| Generally offers higher speeds (up to 10 Gbps with modern Ethernet). | Typically slower speeds, often below 1 Gbps, depending on the technology (e.g., Wi-Fi). |
| Highly reliable; less prone to interference and signal degradation. | Less reliable; affected by physical obstructions and electronic interference. |
| More secure; physical access is required to connect devices, making unauthorized access difficult. | Less secure; signals can be intercepted, requiring strong encryption measures (e.g., WPA3). |
| Higher installation costs due to cabling and hardware requirements. | Lower installation costs as it requires less physical infrastructure. |
| Higher maintenance costs due to the need for cable management and hardware upkeep. | Lower maintenance costs; easier to upgrade and expand without extensive rewiring. |
| Requires physical access to the network through cables. | Requires proximity to a wireless access point or router for connectivity. |
| Less flexible; changes in network configuration often require physical alterations. | Greater flexibility; easy to add or remove devices without physical constraints. |
| Typically involves switches, routers, and hubs for connectivity. | Utilizes wireless routers, access points, and antennas for communication. |
